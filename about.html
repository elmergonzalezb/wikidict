<div style="text-align:justify;">WikiDict was created in the need for a free and open online dictionary, in which the license for the underlying database allows the reuse of the data in the sense of open-source projects. The Wikipedia project offers this kind of information in the form of Wiktionary. This dictionary succeeds in holding the balance between quality of content and open participation, but lacks a frontent for translations. At least there's an powerful <a target=new href="http://en.wiktionary.org/w/api.php">API</a> WikiDict uses to translate words between almost every language (someone on StackOverflow actually gave a <a target=new href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/12629421">good example</a>, which was the starting point for this site).
In contrast, similar comercial projects like <a target=new href="http://dict.cc">Dict.cc</a> or <a target=new href="http://leo.org">Leo.org</a>, WikiDict does not restrict the access to data, which was in the first place voluntarily contributed by a community.<br>
The idea of offering an open online dictionary or even a full text translation service isn't new, <a target=new href="http://wikidict.de">Wikidict.de</a>, <a target=new href="http://apertium.org">Apertium.org</a>, <a target=new href="http://dict.uni-leipzig.de/dictd">FreeDict</a>, <a target=new href="http://dict.org">Dict.org</a> or <a target=new href="http://www.stardict.org/index.php">StarDict</a> partially achieved that goal but some projects discontinues, failed in the fundamental approach, are not userfriendly enough or missing important functionalities.
